Leeds TOR Phantom
-----------------

The Leeds phantom is used to measure image quality metrics for the kV imager of a linac. It contains both
high and low contrast ROIs.

Running the Leeds Demo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the Leeds TOR demo, create a script or start an interpreter session and input::

    from pylinac import LeedsTOR

    LeedsTOR.run_demo()

A figure showing the phantom, low contrast plot, and RMTF will be generated:

.. image:: images/leeds_analysis.png

Image Acquisition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can acquire the images any way you like. Just ensure that the phantom is not touching a field edge. It
is also recommended by the manufacturer to rotate the phantom to a non-cardinal angle so that pixel aliasing does not occur for the
high-contrast line pairs.

Typical Use
^^^^^^^^^^^

Import the class::

    from pylinac import LeedsTOR

The minimum needed to get going is to:

* **Load image** -- Load the planar image as you would any other class: by passing the path directly to the constructor::

      leeds = LeedsTOR('my/leeds.dcm')

  Alternatively, a URL can be passed::

      leeds = LeedsTOR.from_url('http://myserver.com/leeds')

  You may also use the demo image::

      leeds = LeedsTOR.from_demo_image()

* **Analyze the images** -- Analyze the image using the :meth:`~pylinac.planar_imaging.LeedsTOR.analyze` method. The
  low and high contrast thresholds can be specified::

      leeds.analyze(low_contrast_threshold=0.01, hi_contrast_threshold=0.5)

* **View the results** -- The results of analysis can be viewed with the :meth:`~pylinac.planar_imaging.LeedsTOR.plot_analyzed_image`
  method.

    .. code-block:: python

      leeds.plot_analyzed_image()


  .. image:: images/leeds_analysis.png

  Note that each subimage can be turned on or off.

  .. code-block:: python

      # don't show the low contrast plot
      leeds.plot_analyzed_image(low_contrast=False)

  The figure can also be saved::

      leeds.save_analyzed_image('myprofile.png')

 A PDF report can also be generated::

      leeds.publish_pdf('leeds_october16.pdf')

Algorithm
^^^^^^^^^

Leeds phantom analysis is straightforward: find the phantom in the image, then sample ROIs at the appropriate
locations.

The algorithm works like such:

**Allowances**

* The images can be acquired at any SID.
* The images can be acquired with any size kV imager.
* The phantom can be at any distance.
* The phantom can be at any angle.
* The phantom can be flipped either way.

**Restrictions**

    .. warning:: Analysis can fail or give unreliable results if any Restriction is violated.

* The phantom must not be touching or close to any image edges.

**Pre-Analysis**

* **Determine phantom location** -- The Leeds phantom is found by performing a canny edge detection
  algorithm to the image. The thin structures found are sifted by finding appropriately-sized ROIs.
  This may include the outer phantom edge and the metal ring just inside. The average central position
  of the circular ROIs is set as the phantom center.
* **Determine phantom angle** -- To find the rotational angle of the phantom, a similar process is employed,
  but square-like features are searched for in the edge detection image. Because there are two square areas,
  the ROI with the highest attenuation (lead) is chosen. The angle between the phantom center and the lead
  square center is set as the angle.
* **Determine rotation direction** -- The phantom might be placed upside down. To keep analysis consistent,
  a circular profile is sampled at the radius of the low contrast ROIs starting at the lead square. Peaks are
  searched for on each semicircle. The side with the most peaks is the side with the higher contrast ROIs.
  Analysis is always done counter-clockwise. If the ROIs happen to be clockwise, the image is flipped
  left-right and angle/center inverted.

**Analysis**

* **Calculate low contrast** -- Because the phantom center and angle are known, the angles to the ROIs can also
  be known. For each contrast ROI, both it and a background ROI are sampled. From here, the contrast can be known:
  :math:`Contrast_{ROI} = \frac{ROI_{val} - ROI_{background}}{ROI_{val} + ROI_{background}}`.
* **Calculate high contrast** -- Again, because the phantom position and angle are known, offsets are applied
  to sample the high contrast line pair regions. For each sample, the relative MTF is calculated:
  :math:`MTF_{ROI} = \frac{ROI_{max} - ROI_{min}}{ROI_{max} + ROI_{min}}`.

**Post-Analysis**

* **Determine passing low and high contrast ROIs** -- For each low and high contrast region, the determined
  value is compared to the threshold. The plot colors correspond to the pass/fail status.

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you're having trouble getting the Leeds phantom analysis to work, first check out the :ref:`general_troubleshooting`
section. If the issue is not listed there, then it may be one of the issues below.

The most common reason for failing is having the phantom near an image edge. The resulting
error is usually that the phantom angle cannot be determined. For example, this image would throw an
error:

.. image:: images/bad_leeds.jpg

The below image also fails. Technically, the phantom is in the image, but the top blade skews the pixel
values such that the phantom edge cannot be properly found at the top. This fails to identify the true phantom
edge, causing the angle to also not be found:

.. image:: images/bad_leeds2.jpg

Another problem is that the image may have a non-uniform background. This can cause pylinac's automatic
inversion correction to incorrectly invert the image. For example, this image falsely inverts:

.. image:: images/leeds_uneven.jpg

When analyzed, the angle is 180 degrees opposite the lead square, causing the ROIs to be
flipped 180 degrees. To correct this problem, pass ``invert=True`` to :meth:`~pylinac.planar_imaging.LeedsTOR.analyze`.
This will force pylinac to invert the image the opposite way and correctly identify the lead square.


Standard Imaging QC-3 Phantom
-----------------------------

The Standard Imaging phantom is an MV imaging quality assurance phantom and has high and low contrast regions,
just as the Leeds phantom, but with different geometric configurations.

Running the StandardImagingQC3 Demo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the Standard Imaging demo, create a script or start an interpreter session and input::

    from pylinac import StandardImagingQC3

    StandardImagingQC3.run_demo()

A figure showing the phantom, low contrast plot, and RMTF will be generated:

.. image:: images/pipspro_analysis.png

.. _pipspro_image_acquisition:

Image Acquisition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Standard Imaging phantom has a specific setup as recommended by the manufacturer. The phantom should be angled 45
degrees, with the "1" pointed toward the gantry stand and centered along the CAX. For best results when using pylinac,
open the jaws to fully cover the EPID.

Typical Use
^^^^^^^^^^^

Import the class::

    from pylinac import StandardImagingQC3

The minimum needed to get going is to:

* **Load image** -- Load the planar image as you would any other class: by passing the path directly to the constructor::

      qc3 = StandardImagingQC3('path/to/qc3.dcm')

  Alternatively, a URL can be passed::

      qc3 = StandardImagingQC3.from_url('http://myserver.com/myQC3image.dcm')

  You may also use the demo image::

      qc3 = StandardImagingQC3.from_demo_image()

* **Analyze the images** -- Analyze the image using the :meth:`~pylinac.planar_imaging.StandardImagingQC3.analyze` method. The
  low and high contrast thresholds can be specified::

      qc3.analyze(low_contrast_threshold=0.01, hi_contrast_threshold=0.5)

* **View the results** -- The results of analysis can be viewed with the :meth:`~pylinac.planar_imaging.StandardImagingQC3.plot_analyzed_image`
  method. Note that each subimage can be turned on or off.::

      # don't show the low contrast plot
      qc3.plot_analyzed_image(low_contrast=False)

  .. image:: images/pipspro_no_lc.png

  The figure can also be saved::

      qc3.save_analyzed_image('myqc3.png')

 A PDF report can also be generated::

      qc3.publish_pdf('myqc3-june.pdf')

Algorithm
^^^^^^^^^

The algorithm works like such:

**Allowances**

* The images can be acquired at any SID.
* The phantom can be at any distance.
* The images can be acquired with any EPID.
* The phantom can be somewhat offset from the ideal 45 degree orientation.

**Restrictions**

    .. warning:: Analysis can fail or give unreliable results if any Restriction is violated.

* The phantom must not be touching any image edges.
* The phantom should have the "1" pointing toward the gantry stand.

**Pre-Analysis**

* **Determine phantom location** -- A canny edge search is performed on the image. Connected edges that
  are semi-round and angled are thought to possibly be the phantom. Of the ROIs, the one with the longest
  axis is said to be the phantom edge. The center of the bounding box of the ROI is set as the phantom center.
* **Determine phantom radius and angle** -- The major axis length of the ROI determined above serves as the
  phantom radius. The orientation of the edge ROI serves as the phantom angle.

**Analysis**

* **Calculate low contrast** -- Because the phantom center and angle are known, the angles to the ROIs can also
  be known. For each contrast ROI, both it and a background ROI are sampled. From here, the contrast can be known:
  :math:`Contrast_{ROI} = \frac{ROI_{val} - ROI_{background}}{ROI_{val} + ROI_{background}}`.
* **Calculate high contrast** -- Again, because the phantom position and angle are known, offsets are applied
  to sample the high contrast line pair regions. For each sample, the relative MTF is calculated:
  :math:`MTF_{ROI} = \frac{ROI_{max} - ROI_{min}}{ROI_{max} + ROI_{min}}`.

**Post-Analysis**

* **Determine passing low and high contrast ROIs** -- For each low and high contrast region, the determined
  value is compared to the threshold. The plot colors correspond to the pass/fail status.

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you're having issues with the StandardImaging class, make sure you have correctly positioned the phantom as per
the manufacturer's instructions (also see :ref:`pipspro_image_acquisition`). One issue that may arise is incorrect
inversion. If the jaws are closed tightly around the phantom, the automatic inversion correction may falsely
invert the image, just as for the Leeds phantom. If you have an image that looks inverted or just plain weird, add ``invert=True``
to :meth:`~pylinac.planar_imaging.StandardImagingQC3.analyze`. If this doesn't help, reshoot the phantom with the jaws open.


Las Vegas Phantom
-----------------

The Las Vegas phantom is for MV image quality testing and includes low contrast regions of varying contrast and size.

Running the LasVegas Demo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the Las Vegas demo, create a script or start an interpreter session and input:

.. code-block:: python

    from pylinac import LasVegas

    LasVegas.run_demo()

A figure showing the phantom and low contrast plot will be generated:

.. image:: images/las_vegas_analyzed.png

Image Acquisition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Las Vegas phantom has a recommended position as stated on the phantom. Pylinac will however account for angles,
shifts, and inversions. Best practices for the Las Vegas phantom:

* Keep the phantom from a couch edge or any rails.
* Close the jaws around the phantom (i.e. not 30x30cm)
* Place the phantom at approximately 100cm SSD.

Typical Use
^^^^^^^^^^^

Import the class::

    from pylinac import LasVegas

The minimum needed to get going is to:

* **Load image** -- Load the planar image as you would any other class: by passing the path directly to the constructor::

      lv = LasVegas('path/to/lasvegasphan.dcm')

  Alternatively, a URL can be passed::

      lv = LasVegas.from_url('http://myserver.com/myLVimage.dcm')

  You may also use the demo image::

      lv = LasVegas.from_demo_image()

* **Analyze the images** -- Analyze the image using the :meth:`~pylinac.planar_imaging.LasVegas.analyze` method. The
  low and high contrast thresholds can be specified::

      lv.analyze(low_contrast_threshold=0.01)

* **View the results** -- The results of analysis can be viewed with the :meth:`~pylinac.planar_imaging.LasVegas.plot_analyzed_image`
  method. Note that each subimage can be turned on or off.::

      # don't show the low contrast plot
      lv.plot_analyzed_image(low_contrast=False)

  The figure can also be saved::

      lv.save_analyzed_image('mylvplot.png')

 A PDF report can also be generated::

      lv.publish_pdf('lv-3-10-17.pdf')
